        q: "What is SuperLeadz?",
        a: " SuperLeadz is a lead generation tool to generate 100% self-verified leads, engage them with on-site incentives tailored by visit frequency and engagement, and facilitate one-click offer redemptions for a frictionless purchase journey."
    },
    {
        q: "How is SuperLeadz different from other lead generation & conversion tools?",
        a: (
            <div>
                <p>SuperLeadz is markedly different from other lead generation tools, mainly in these aspects:</p>
                <p>

                    i. Lead Verification: SuperLeadz employs a Dual Verification Process, validating
                    both the authenticity and purchase intent of website visitors through OTP
                    verification. This guarantees the generation of 100% self-verified leads, who
                    can then be incentivized with offers personalized by visit frequency &
                    engagement.</p>
                <p>
                    ii.  Diverse Offer Creation: Merchants can create different types of offers, from
                    flat discount on order value to Buy & Get Free offers.</p>
                <p>
                    iii.Multiple Offer Display: Visitors can choose from multiple offers in a single
                    pop-up interaction, increasing the likelihood of conversions.</p>
                <p>
                    iv.One-Click Offer Redemptions: Leads can click the "Redeem" button adjacent
                    to their selected offer in the pop-up and continue shopping. The chosen offer
                    is automatically applied during the checkout process (even if the shopper
                    forgets!)</p>
            </div >
        )
    },
    {

                <p>iii. Personalize your communication & incentives for first-time visitors, returning shoppers and registered users</p>
                <p>iv. Display multiple offers within a single pop-up interaction for a lead to choose
                    from</p>
                <p> v. Hyper-customize your pop-ups (multiple offer display, multiple page redirects,

                    <p> c. Buy X, Get Y: Customers receive a discount on the second or subsequent

                    particular discount code or offer can be used. This feature helps businesses control the
                    distribution and utilization of discounts based on a predetermined usage limit.

                    set on the total usage of the discount, restricting the number of times customers can
                    apply the discount code to their purchases. Once the maximum use count is reached,
                    the discount code becomes invalid or inactive.
