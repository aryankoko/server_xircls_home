She observes the correlation between the degradation of mental health and the circulation of images popular Tech companies use to influence their “ideals” on mainstream culture. With the help of the XIRCLS team, she strives to bring an awareness to the public about the manipulative tactics used by AdTech and MarTech giants, and how they have shifted the priorities of the masses from those of value to a distorted and diluted version of a Hollywood movie.',
      'Allie was born in Douglas, Georgia in the United States of America. She spent her childhood in Tampa, Florida and her adolescence in Northeast Tennessee. Even at a young age, Allie had quite an affinity for writing, winning her first scholarship in a state-wide contest in the fifth grade by the age of 12. Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, she took several honors classes in Creative Writing and English, allowing her to develop and perfect her writing style. Throughout this time, she received several awards and accolades for her writing accomplishments, and decided to pursue Mass Communications in College, minoring in Broadcast Journalism at East Tennessee State University. After her freshman year, she took time off to pursue sales and had hopes to soon relocate.',
      'She eventually moved from Johnson City, Tennessee Charlotte, North Carolina where she transferred her credits to University of North Carolina Charlotte. Using her electives to explore Religion and Sexuality, Anthropology, Sociology and Epidemiology classes, she realized her writing interests were better suited toward the study of human behaviour. She changed her major to Psychology with a concentration in Media and Technology, in which she thrives at the University of Phoenix.',
      'Allie is a member of the National Society of Leadership and Success as well as The Golden Key International Honour Society where she currently attends courses to enhance her leadership skills as well as network with likeminded peers.',

          'Most people would say they don’t like conflict. It doesn’t feel good— it’s disruptive, tense, uncomfortable, perhaps even torturous. It is often perceived as an enemy that needs to be defeated in order for us to restore happiness. One thing worth exploring, however, is instead reconceptualising conflict as our greatest tool one that builds what everyone is ultimately seeking in life: connection.',
          'Think of yourself as a crying child. In that moment of conflict, what did you ultimately want from your parents the people taking care of you? At your very core, you wanted attention, compassion, empathy, and validation. If conflict is seen as an opportunity rather than a threat, this situation can become a beautiful moment of connection between the child and parent.',
          'As one grows up and becomes an adult, those desires become less apparent to us, and our reactions to their absence may become much more subdued. However, one would be mistaken to think their urgency ever goes away— these are core human needs, after all.',
          'Given that we are now the ones who have to take care of ourselves, it is imperative that we provide ourselves with the same treatment we would have wanted from an available, kind, and loving parent. We often get frustrated with ourselves for our desires or perceived inadequacies we criticise, blame, punish. The truth is that the more we suppress something inside of us, the more it will come out. That part of us is begging to be seen and attended to we would be foolish to think that it can be ignored. It will find ways to come to the surface— all that will happen if we try to suppress it is that it will come out in subconscious ways, without us even realising that we are acting from that hurt part of us. We would therefore do better to consciously spend time with it to approach it with compassion and curiosity. Think of how a plant blossoms: it requires a lot of attention and care to grow. Criticising it won’t make it grow faster!',
          'So what comes out of conflict? Many would say distance and resentment. But if we stop resisting it and instead embrace it with an open mind, it can have a much more positive outcome— that of growth, understanding, and closeness, both with others as well as one-self. Reflect on the most meaningful things to happen in your life. Wasn’t there some kind of internal conflict precipitating those changes, a struggle of some sort?',
          'We at XIRCLS therefore believe that anyone who we feel threatened by is doing us a service. The first step to any positive change is awareness, and they are giving us the gift of just that— they are bringing our attention to what is aching to be seen inside of us. Who knows how long our journey to accepting that part of ourselves would have been delayed if not for them shining a light on it? It is precisely in this way that conflict can, if met with curiosity and openness, lead to connection— in this case, a deeper connection with oneself and one’s desires.'

          (<>Please reread the heading above. Now, let me go ahead and explain this extended metaphor. A panopticon, as you can see in the picture <a href={link} className={TNone}>here</a>, is an institutional building designed by <a href={link} className={TNone}>Jeremy Bentham</a>. The building consists of a tower in the center for the guardian or watchman, and it is surrounded by a circular shaped building of cells. This architectural outline’s salient purpose is to surveil its occupants, without them knowing when or why they are being monitored and watched. At the same time, the occupants of the rooms cannot look into the central tower. This building is the best way to see others, to have power over others, without them having power over you. Evidently there is an absence of reciprocity and connectedness in this type of relationship, between the guardian in the tower and the inhabitants. Michael Foucault describes this interrelation quite exquisitely in his book Discipline and Punish (1975):</>),
          (<>
            <span className="text-body-tertiary">
              <i>“He is seen, but he does not see he is an object of information, never a subject in communication.”</i> Michael Foucault
            </span>
          </>),
          'Therefore, the inhabitant is trapped and cornered into a one-sided relationship.',
          'How does the notion of target audience fit in this analogy? Well, the company who sells a product or service has the power to deceive individuals who they deem are part of their target audience into entering a unilateral and unequal relationship. The customer is an object of information they are monitored, controlled, but not worthy enough to be part of the conversation. The customer is studied as an experiment, but they do not know which treatment or intervention they will receive. The customer is exposed to a variety of stimuli or marketing tricks and strategies without even a debriefing session, or enough information in order to make a rational decision. The customer is first chosen and placed under a microscope, then scrutinised and ripped apart, in order for companies to grasp each and every detail of their ‘target audience’. When their ‘targets’ are settled and selected, they fight for them with their competitors, and these targets become ‘prey’.',
          'How do we end up inside a panopticon over and over again? I will attempt to explain some of the reasons in this post.'

          'How do we end up under a microscope? How do we become an inmate in an 18th century prison? How do we allow someone to study every single detail about us without consciously understanding their motivation? How do we share private and intimate information without even noticing or comprehending? Some of the major characters that make this happen are data brokers.',
          'Data brokers are companies that we are not familiar with. However, they know you more than you’ll ever imagine. Their job includes selling your personal information. They make a profit out of your intimate moments. Why? Well, because all this information is tremendously valuable to other companies. They are able to do this because of complex algorithms that allow them to analyse personal details including: demographic information, religious beliefs, political leanings, sexual history, purchasing power, hobbies, medical history, physical and personality traits.',
          'One of the significant problems concerning this practice is it entails a threat. When the user agrees to the sharing and compilation of their personal data, most of the time they are not aware of where the data is going to end up, who receives and analyses it, and for how long they can store and process it. The data obtained is not always used for fraudulent activities, some of the data is used to improve and facilitate the user’s life. Nonetheless, the issue revolves around the inability of the user to accurately and consciously understand to what extent their data is being used, and with what purpose.',
          'Data brokers have access to information you probably do not let your inner circle have access to, in some cases you don’t even let yourself acknowledge that information about you. Hence, just like in the Panopticon, you are selected, regularly monitored and analysed by a company, a data broker, or an individual that you know nothing about. Do you know one of the worst similarities between the panopticon and the algorithm used to access your information? Once you go in, you can never come out of it.',
          'In this way, data brokers effectuate the sharing of inconceivable amounts of personal data, what the world has come to call ‘Big Data’. Data brokers are the owners of the central tower inside the Panopticon and they allow the company or guard to monitor their targets.',
          'After the company has enough information in order to identify their target audience they make sure to make use of your information in order to convince you to never leave the Panopticon - they call this loyalty. They disguise the words prey, war, quarry, behind concepts such as ‘target audience’ and ‘market competition’. Despite all of this, how do the companies distract and deflect us from everything that is going on under our nose?'

          'Marketing has become a playground of deception and schemes. With every click, they create new tricks. Did you know some websites pay people to click on their ads, because they earn revenue from it? Thus sometimes ‘target customers’ are not even customers: they are not even real! With such tricks companies are able to distract us from what is actually going on.',
          'I would like to illustrate one prevalent example of deception nowadays: influencers. A company identifies which influencers have an impact over their target audience and they collaborate with them. Nevertheless, in many cases you are not involved in this collaboration, because no one cooperates with you as the customer. When an influencer proceeds to promote certain products or services to uninformed consumers, you are reduced to being nothing more than collateral damage.',
          'As consumers we should make an effort in order to be literate about any product or service we intend to buy. Still, it is unethical, vain, and crass of some influencers to promote a product without being educated about it, and even more, if they decide to withhold given information in order to make a better case for the product or service.',
          'Another example is artificial scarcity, a supposed scarcity of products. The company pretends the product’s availability is lower than it actually is. Artificial scarcity plays around with the laws of supply and demand, since the perceived difficulty of obtaining the limited product makes it more valuable. This marketing strategy creates an illusion where the supply decreases, so the demand increases. This fuels a feeling of social anxiety, and companies have heard about it and applied it to their advantage. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is marketing speak more than anything, a means to convince consumers they are indeed missing out on something someone else is experiencing. This marketing strategy or scheme induces fear and anxiety and in spite of that, companies use it against us and even create artificial situations or environments.'

But, their goal was never for us to reach the ideal self we wish for nor for us to feel happy or accomplished. Their goal is to make us feel unhappy and incompetent, because that is the only way we would still buy their lies and their products.

          'Stockholm Syndrome is a paradox where the victim develops a close and strong bond towards their captor or kidnapper. When the victim feels the captor or guard has too much power over them, when they feel threatened, they start creating a bond. When the guard decides not to harm the victim, then the victim feels immensely grateful and indebted to the captor.',

In fact, the value of the partner offers they receive may not just be equal to, but perhaps even greater than the value of the purchase. When a customer can gain more value than value lost, he is sure to return.',
